React Context Error Notes

Error: useSoulHug must be used within a SoulHugProvider

This error means a component (such as <DefinePage>) is calling the useSoulHug hook outside of the SoulHugProvider context. To fix:
- Ensure all components using useSoulHug are children of <SoulHugProvider> in your component tree.
- Wrap your <App /> or main router in <SoulHugProvider> in App.tsx.

React Error Boundaries:
Consider adding an error boundary to your tree to customize error handling behavior.
